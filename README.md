# collabvmdl.ml-Source
Source of the new ‘collabvmdl.ml’


# Leaked
I have leaked the source of this.


## Why?
Because I planned for this to be a download center, but because Unzor and Desktopgoose thought it was a good idea to host **literal malware** on the server, we got shut down. Then desktop goose decided to use the domain for himself.
